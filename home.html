                    <p>Natural sunlight is critical for immune system functioning, hormone balancing, stress reduction, regulating sleep cycles, bone health, heart health, fertility, and so much more. </p>
                    <p>Sunlight supports our health in a myriad of ways from enriching our bodies with Vitamin D, enhancing our immune system functioning, aiding bone health and heart health, balancing our hormones, and much more.</p>
                    <p>Sunlight received through our eyes triggers the release of serotonin, a hormone that makes us feel happy, calm, and focused.</p>
                    <p>Decreased sunlight exposure is associated with low serotonin levels which can lead to depression, anxiety, weight gain, PMS, fatigue, and sleep disorders.</p>

                <h2>Drink pure water</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>Optimal hydration is vital for all the systems of the body to function properly.</p>
                    <p>Water helps to transport nutrients and oxygen throughout the body to boost metabolism, to enhance digestion, keep our skin healthy, and to support brain health.</p>
                    <p>Water is so important for our whole health, that if we get dehydrated our physical performance and mental functioning both start to quickly suffer. A loss of motivation, fatigue, and trouble thinking are common side-effects of dehydration. Even mild dehydration can lead to major consequences and impairment.</p>
                    <p>If you don't enjoy drinking plain water, try adding a squeeze of lemon or lime juice to your water. In addition to boosting the flavor, it also will provide extra Vitamin C and help support healthy digestion, reduce inflammation, and promote glowing skin. You can also add all kinds of fresh fruits and herbs to your water for extra flavor and nutrition, such as cucumbers, berries, melon cubes, mint, or lemon balm.</p>
                    <p>Water can energize your body, transform your state of mind, and refresh your spirit in so many ways!</p>

                    <p>Eating healthy food builds our body, supports wellness and protects us from illness.</p>
                    <p>Our bodies need a wide variety of vitamins and minerals every day that are provided by nourishing ourselves with good food.</p>
                    <p>Enjoying a diverse diet with an emphasis on organic plant foods consisting of fresh vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds, plus a moderate amount of wild cold-water finfish, pastured dairy, and grass-fed meats is the basis for vibrant health and wellness.</p>
                    <p>Today, modern diets are high in processed food and low in nutrients and variety due to industrial farming practices.</p>

                    <p>Through healthy and positive socialization with others, we grow and flourish in health. Research has shown that babies grow faster and stronger with touch, eye-to-eye connection, and the sound of loving voices. All ages need human connection and touch.</p>
                    <p>Socialization, touch, and connection help to increase mental and emotional health, and decrease the risk of dementia for the elderly. Connecting with others socially supports brain health, boosts immunity, increases longevity, and prevents loneliness and depression.</p>

                    <p>Reach out and connect with a friend, family member, neighbor, or someone you would like to get to know better today and let them know you've been thinking about them, wanted to let them know you care about them.</p>

                    <p>Getting outside each day, in every season, is the best thing we can do to boost our mood and our health.</p>
                    <p>The sunlight is important, but so is fresh air and exercise. Even in northern climates in the darker months, getting outside for a walk during the day has multiple benefits that will help to stabilize mood and wellness. Spending time outdoors also connects us to nature, and helps us to entrain to the rhythm of the seasons, which supports the health of our own biological clocks.</p>
                    <p>The more you get in sync with nature, the more you support your natural health.</p>

                    <p>Healthy movement is an essential self-care practice for long life. Our bodies need to move to thrive.</p>
                    <p>Movement is necessary for every system in our body to function. When people think about movement, the first thought is often exercise, but it's much more than that. Movement is about dynamic action, utilizing the full range of motion of our bodies, and avoiding stagnant practices.</p>
                    <p>Moving our bodies regularly, fully, and in new challenging ways supports our cardiovascular and muscular health - and also enhances our ability to think clearly, process emotions, and to express ourselves.</p>
                    <p>When we move, our muscles contract, we load our bones and connective tissue, we release certain hormones, our cells signal each other, our respiration increases, and our circulation is enhanced.</p>
                    <p>It doesn't matter where you are starting from, every movement makes a difference for the better.</p>
                    <p>There are many ways to move, and it's important to find ways that work for our body and lifestyle.</p>

                <h2>Sleep in darkness</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <p>The art of resting is one of the most underrated, yet most wonderful, facets of whole health. We live in a culture that pushes to do more, work harder, be relentless, go bigger, and idolizes overachieving. However, balance is essential, and regularly taking time for a full rest gives us the ability to take smarter actions with more efficiency, enthusiasm, and energy.</p>
                    <p>Resting is a time of recuperation, healing, and restoring.While your body is sleeping it is actually rejuvenating and repairing itself.By fully resting, sleeping, or napping, your body is able to utilize all the energy that we spend while being awake doing so many things to focus on healing our cells, tissues, brain, and body. During sleep, our bodies are also busy producing hormones that are essential for regulating our biological clock, supporting health, and reducing stress.</p>
                    <p>It's also deeply healing and restoring to the body, mind, and spirit to take a break from regular activities and work periodically to simply allow yourself the time to be at rest.</p>
                    <p>Make sure to prioritize good sleep each day as well as taking a day each week to fully rest and recuperate from work and chores.</p>
